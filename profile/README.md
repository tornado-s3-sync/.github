### My files aren't syncing!
If your files aren't syncing, there are a few things you can check to make sure everything is configured correctly.
* Verify your IAM User has the correct permissions
* Verify your `S3 Bucket Region` matches the region of your bucket
* Verify your `Bucket Path` is correct
* Verify your `Sync Directory` is correct
* Verify you've clicked "Sync Now" after making changes to your settings to trigger the sync timer

### I keep having to select my local directory!
Unfortunately, due to the nature of MacOS' filesystem, we're unable to persist the directory you've on app restarts. We're working on a fix for this, but for now, you'll have to select your directory every time you open Tornado S3 Sync.

Fortunately, however, once you've set your local path, as long as you don't close Tornado S3 Sync, you won't have to select your directory again!
