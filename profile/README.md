# Tornado S3 Sync 🌪️
Welcome to the easiest way to get your local files to your favorite Amazon S3 bucket!

---

## 👋 Introduction
There are a _LOT_ of options when it comes to getting your data from a local machine to your favorite Amazon S3 bucket. The Tornado S3 Sync project is, admittedly, another one of those options. However, rather than aim to be _better_, or more feature rich than the other options, Tornado S3 Sync aims to be a _simple_, _elegant_, _set-and-forget_ tool to keep your files backed up safely and securely.
